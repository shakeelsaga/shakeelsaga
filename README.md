# Hi there, I'm Mohammed Shakeel 👋

I’m a Computer Science student with a simple philosophy: **If I have to do a task more than twice, I script it.**

My journey into engineering started with a frustration we all share—repetitive, manual grunt work. I realized that clicking buttons in the AWS Console wasn't just boring, it was error-prone and slow. That frustration turned into an obsession with **Cloud Automation**, **Python**, and building tools that respect a developer's time.

Here is what I’ve been building to fix that.

##  Selected Projects

### 1. CloudPail — Terminal-Based S3 Manager
*The Problem:* Managing S3 buckets via the AWS Console is slow, but the standard CLI is error-prone and hard to memorize.
*The Solution:* I built **[CloudPail](https://github.com/shakeelsaga/CloudPail)**, a Python TUI (Terminal User Interface) that combines the visual safety of a GUI with the speed of the command line.
* **Tech:** Python, Boto3, Rich Library
* **Impact:** Implemented "safety-first" pre-flight checks to prevent accidental deletions and automated region detection to handle cross-region buckets seamlessly.

### 2. Serverless DevOps Automations
*The Problem:* Manual maintenance tasks (like deleting old backups) are easily forgotten, leading to wasted costs and security risks.
*The Solution:* I developed the **[Serverless Functions Collection](https://github.com/shakeelsaga/Serverless-Functions-Collection)**, a library of event-driven Lambda functions that act as a 24/7 operations team.
* **Tech:** AWS Lambda, EventBridge, IAM
* **Key Modules:** An "EBS Lifecycle Manager" that prunes snapshots older than 7 days, and a "Security Group Auditor" that auto-remediates open SSH ports.

### 3. SourceFolio — Research Data CLI
*The Problem:* Aggregating data from multiple public sources for research reports was a manual, copy-paste nightmare.
*The Solution:* I created **[SourceFolio](https://github.com/shakeelsaga/SourceFolio)**, a CLI tool that automates the research loop by fetching data from APIs and exporting structured PDF/CSV reports instantly.
* **Tech:** Python, API Integration, ReportLab

##  My Toolkit
I focus on tools that help me move fast and break fewer things.

* **Languages:** Python (my daily driver), SQL
* **Cloud:** AWS (Lambda, S3, EC2, IAM, EventBridge)
* **Libraries:** Boto3, Rich, Click
